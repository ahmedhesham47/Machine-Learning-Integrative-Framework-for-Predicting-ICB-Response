# Machine-Learning-Integrative-Framework-for-Predicting-ICB-Response
A Machine Learning course project that aims to predict the response to ICB therapy using integrative data sources --> Clinical, Gene Expression, Gene Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Mutation, and Gene Copy Number Alteration Mutation.

We tested 3 classifiers, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, on two datasets: Liu and Ravi.

To run the code, just import the packages and files of your desired dataset (Liu or Ravi), and run the code sequentially.
